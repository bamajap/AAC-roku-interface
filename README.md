# tobii-roku-interface

This repository contains instructions (and source code) that will allow Tobii Dynavox users to setup their AAC device to control Roku devices through the Communicator software.

The Roku_Remote.zip file is there for illustrative purposes only.  It is a snapshot of the version of the files at an unspecified point in time.  The files in this zip will probably work, but is not guaranteed to work with your system.  To get the latest version of the scripts, please use the scripts in the repository and refer to the website (or Github) link for the latest/greatest version of the curl software.

For help, create a new issue and I will do my best to offer a quick response.
