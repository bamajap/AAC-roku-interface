# tobii-roku-interface

This repository contains instructions (and source code) that will allow Tobii Dynavox and PRC Accent users to setup their Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device to control Roku devices.

The Roku_Remote.zip file is there for illustrative purposes only.  It is a snapshot of the version of the files at an unspecified point in time.  The files in this zip will probably work, but is not guaranteed to work with your system.  To get the latest version of the scripts, please use the scripts in the repository and refer to the website (or Github) link for the latest/greatest version of the curl software.

NOTE: Out of the box, this code is written specifically for a Tobii device, however, I was able to leverage these scripts to work with a PRC Accent 1400 device as well.

For help, create a new issue and I will do my best to offer a quick response.
